# *Carpe iter*: A Case for Latin-Themed Field Trips
Classical Association of the Atlantic States Annual Meeting  
Session: Pedagogical Possibilities
October 11, 2014

{:.paper-section-heading}
## Abstract 
An informal series of *Itinera Latina* have taken place in New York City in recent years. These began in 2008 with Prof. Matthew McGowan's *Iter Botanicum* at the New York Botanical Gardens. Following this example, there have been similar walks such as the *Iter Zoologicum* at the Bronx Zoo and the *Iter Museicum* at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. These events provide a social context for practicing Latin outside of the classroom and a much- needed leisure activity to accompany the rigors of formal instruction. In this paper I will argue for the benefits of Latin-themed field trips for learners all of ages and levels, specifically that they offer learning experiences which are: 1. authentic, 2. direct, 3. free-choice, 4. novel, and 5. fun. The first part of this paper will be a review of the three *Itinera* listed above, including the motivations for organizing the walks, a brief history of the events, and anecdotes about student participation. At the heart of the talk will be a discussion about how the events fit into the larger landscape of Latin learning. The walks have an affinity with aspects of the active Latin movement, such as the spoken-Latin *conventicula* and *cenae Latinae* which have gained in popularity in recent years: 1. They all seek to provide a contemporary and immediate context in which Latin students practice their language skills, and 2.They promote a social rather than educational mode of learning. Accordingly, this paper will situate the walks in this larger context of the pedagogical goals of active Latin. I will conclude with practical advice for those interested in organizing an *Iter Latinum* for their own school or community.
