# Latin Language and Literature: Curriculum Authors

*Taught at Fordham University \(LATN 2001.2\), Fall 2009. This course met 3 times a week in 50-minute blocks.*

## Overview

The aims of this course are to:

- Read short selections from a wide variety of Latin authors
- Review and strengthen Latin vocabulary and grammar
- Pursue individual interests in Latin literature
- Develop a general appreciation for Latin literature and the tradition of medieval education

Your grade will be based on the following:

- three exams
- an independent reading project
- participation and attendance

## Required Texts

- *Beginning Latin Poetry Reader*. G. Betts and D. Franklin. ISBN 0071458859. Available at bookstore.
- Handouts will be distributed for other readings.

You will also need a good dictionary. I have ordered Cassell's Latin Dictionary for the bookstore.

## Class Preparation

You are expected to read the Latin for each assignment in full before class as well as memorize all vocabulary and review points of grammar and syntax. You should translate sentences that cause you difficulty, but I encourage you not to translate the assignments in full. You should concentrate on reading and understanding the Latin. You will not be able to refer to translations in class. I encourage you to ask questions in class about lines which cause you difficulty with vocabulary, grammar, comprehension, etc. We will spend time throughout the semester discussing strategies for developing good Latin reading skills.

## Independent Reading

In the first three semesters of your Latin studies, you have been exposed to small, disconnected bits of Latin literature—Wheelock alone provides numerous loci and sententiae from Seneca, Cicero, Virgil, and so on. For the independent reading projects, I would like you to choose asubstantial work from the Latin corpus which you will read in English on your own during the second half of the semester. As you read I want you to select one passage that particularly interests you—about 40-50 lines—which you will prepare in Latin. I will email you periodically to check on your progress and I will meet with you individually in the final weeks of the semester to discuss your reading and review your Latin preparation.

## Attendance and Participation

You are expected to attend every class. This course will move quickly through different authors and topics and there will be no real substitute for the time we spend reading together as a class. If you cannot attend class, you must email me beforehand. More than two unexcused absences will adversely affect your participation grade.

## Grading

- Three (3) exams @ 20% each = 60%
- Independent Reading, 15%
- Participation and Attendance, 25%


## Academic Integrity

In accordance with the university's policies, you are expected to present your own work on homework assignments, quizzes, exams, and other assignments. For more information, please consult the Standards of Academic Integrity available on the Fordham website.

## Support Services

Any student with a documented disability needing academic accommodation should speak with me and the Director of Disability Services as soon as possible.
