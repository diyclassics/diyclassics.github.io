# Review of P.L. Chambers's *The Natural Histories of Pliny the Elder* 
Book review for Classical Outlook 89.2    

{:.paper-section-heading}
## Sample
Latin students eager to move from textbooks to literature are adequately supplied with readers from the canonical authors. Increasingly, however, we are seeing books designed to stretch the canon a bit. P. L. Chambers pursued this strategy with *The Attic Nights of Aulus Gellius* (Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 2009), and here she offers another alternative with *The Natural Histories of Pliny the Elder*, a reader which presents 25 excerpts from Pliny’s encyclopedia. The topics are well chosen, and Chambers supplements the material with an ample review of grammar. The book is a good option for instructors looking to broaden their students’ exposure to Latin literature in an upper-level reading course.
 
Chambers writes that she selected passages that are “entertaining, enlightening, and revealing of Roman thought, character, philosophy, and prejudice” (ix). She succeeds here: we get choice excerpts which demonstrate Pliny’s range and cover geography, zoology, precious metals and gems, art, magic, and Roman social history among other topics. With this something-for-everyone approach, a teacher could easily pick and choose readings based on his or her own needs. Some of my favorites included “Cases of and Roman Respect for Intellectual Eminence,” “Pearls; Cleopatra’s Pearls and Her Wager with Antony,” and “Wolves and Werewolves.” [469 more words in complete review available [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43940167).]
