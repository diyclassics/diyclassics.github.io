# Intermediate Latin  

*Taught at Fordham University \(LATN 1501.1\), Fall 2019. This course met 2 times a week in 70-minute blocks.*  

## Overview  

The aims of this course are to:  

- Review, complete, and expand on the foundation of Latin grammar acquired in the two introductory courses.  
- Develop a working knowledge of the core Latin vocabulary (~1000-1500 words).  
- Build the confidence to read extended, continuous passages of Latin.  
- Gain exposure to resources—and especially online and/or open-access resources—useful for the study of Latin literature.  
- Learn the basics of commentary writing, including maintaining vocabulary lists and identifying selections for further explanation of grammar and context, with a focus on collaborative work.  

Your grade will be based on the following:  

- Four exams (inclusive of the final exam)  
- Short weekly quizzes  
- A research project in commentary development  
- Participation and attendance

Class readings are available online at the links given above; in the event that a reading is unavailable, texts will be distributed as handouts in a timely manner. Reference materials that we use for assistance with vocabulary and grammar are similarly available online. If you have any trouble viewing or using online resources, please email me as soon as possible.  

## Class Preparation  

You are expected to read the Latin for each assignment in full **before** class as well as memorize all vocabulary and review points of grammar and syntax. You should translate sentences that cause you difficulty, but I encourage you not to translate the assignments in full. You should concentrate on **reading and understanding** the Latin. You will not be able to refer to translations in class. I encourage you to ask questions in class about lines which cause you difficulty with vocabulary, grammar, comprehension, etc. We will spend time throughout the semester discussing strategies for developing good Latin reading skills. We will also round out your Latin reading skills with various speaking, listening, and writing assignments throughout the semester.  

## Attendance and Participation  

You are expected to attend every class. Moreover, as noted above, you are expected to come to each class **fully prepared** to put new material to work. That is, students should learn the new grammar and vocabulary for assigned readings before the class on which the chapter is assigned. Our classroom time will be spent on **active practice, addressing comprehension questions, and general review**—a sort of Latin laboratory. Accordingly, there is no substitute for this precious opportunity to engage with the four essential components of language acquisition—**reading, writing, speaking, and listening**—with an emphasis this semester on reading, and specifically reading comprehension. The cumulative nature of an intermediate language course makes absences especially difficult to make up—each class builds upon the vocabulary and grammar of the previous classes, not to mention that we will be working this semester with continuous prose passages that will extend over several meetings.  

Absences will only be excused and make-up assignments or quizzes will be only be offered with the required paperwork from the Dean’s Office, specifically the Excused Absence Request Form, https://tiny.cc/fcrhexcusedabsence; submit this paperwork before contacting me about any absences. (On this and related points, I encourage students to review Fordham’s student attendance policies in the Undergraduate Faculty Handbook [Section 2.3].) All work missed during periods of excused absence must be made up in full to earn participation credit. Note also that students are required to take the Final Exam on the scheduled date and time; please make travel plans accordingly.  

## Grading  

- Tests, 4 @ 100 points each = 400 points  
- Quizzes, 10 @ 25 points each = 250 points  
- Collaborative Commentary Project = 250 points  
- Attendance & Participation = 200 points  

Points are converted to letter grades using the following scale:  
A: 1000-940; A-: 939-900; B+: 899-870; B: 869-840; B-: 839-800; C+: 799-770; C: 769-740; C-: 739-700; D+: 699-670; D: 669-640; D-: 639-600; F: 599-0  

A detailed assignment with instructions, a rubric, and grading policy for the Collaborative Commentary project will be distributed on 10/24 after Exam 2.  

*Note that a provision for extra credit is included in total allowance for points.*  

## Academic Integrity and Collaboration  

In accordance with the university’s policies, you are expected to present your own work on the quizzes, exams, and other assignments. For collaborative assignments, it is fully expected that you contribute your fair share of the work as a whole. I will add that in a language-learning environment, where fundamental building blocks accumulate and increase gradually in difficulty, academic dishonesty tends to serve short-term needs and massively betray long-term ones. That is, there is no substitute for the continuous maintenance of acquired skills and the commitment to master new skills. Cheating, copying, failing to contribute your fair share, etc. all preclude this. For more information, please consult the Standards of Academic Integrity available on the Fordham website.  

Note that I fully encourage you work together, form study groups, collaborate on creating study materials, etc. Latin, like any other language, relies on community and I hope that you will all find ways of supporting each other in our classroom language-learning community. We can learn more deeply and more efficiently if we work together in this sort of constructive environment.
