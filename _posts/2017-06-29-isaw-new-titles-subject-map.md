Map-based discovery system for ISAW Library's recent acquisitions. The site uses leaflet.js to display geocoded subjects, e.g. "Egypt (General)" = Lat. 26, Long. 30, and MarkerCluster to handle multiple entries for a given set of coordinates. The site is built in Jekyll and deployed through Github Pages. The live version of the site is available at [https://diyclassics.github.io/marc-pleiades/](https://diyclassics.github.io/marc-pleiades/).
