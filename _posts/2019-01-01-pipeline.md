# Building a Text Analysis Pipeline for Classical Languages
Chapter for Digital Classical Philology (DeGruyter, 2019), ed. M. Berti.

## Abstract
With large text collections for Ancient Greek and Latin now widely available, classicists are increasingly interested in extracting information systematically from these texts. The fields of informational retrieval and natural language processing offer tools and methods to address this, but classical-language support can be limited and researchers must often cobble together separate, sometimes incompatible tools to accomplish basic text analysis tasks. In this chapter, I review the tools currently available for digital philological work on Ancient Greek and Latin and introduce the [Classical Language Toolkit](https://www.cltk.org), an open-source Python framework that addresses the desideratum of a complete text analysis pipeline for historical languages.
