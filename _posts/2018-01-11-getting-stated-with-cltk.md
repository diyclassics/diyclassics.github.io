This is a ongoing project to collect online resources for anybody looking to get started with working with Python for historical languages, esp. using the [Classical Language Toolkit](cltk.org). If you have suggestions for this lists, email me at patrick[at]diyclassics[dot]org.

- Getting started with NLP, practice: Bird/Klein/Loper, Natural Language Processing with Python (“NLTK Book”): [nltk.org/book/](nltk.org/book/), esp. Chs. 1-7; good exercises too; Ch. 4 is a good introduction to Python in general 
- Getting started with NLP, theory (not Python specific): Jurafsky/Manning, Stanford Intro to NLP course videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoudtpBV68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoudtpBV68)
- A-to-Z text analysis tutorial: Riddell, Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences: [https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/index.html](https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/index.html) (not really intro, but really helpful to me over time) 
- Python programming, as an idea: Downey, Think Python: [http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html); good text-focused exercises
- Classical Language Toolkit has its own tutorial page: [github.com/cltk/tutorials](github.com/cltk/tutorials) 
- J. Tauber's blog/github repo has lots of great Python/Greek work [jktauber.com](jktauber.com) & [https://github.com/jtauber?tab=repositories](https://github.com/jtauber?tab=repositories)
- My own Python/Latin/CLTK experiments can be found at the Disiecta Membra blog: [disiectamembra.wordpress.com](disiectamembra.wordpress.com)
- D. Sturgeon's Digital Sinology tutorials come to mind for Python/Classical Chinese text work: [https://digitalsinology.org/classical-chinese-digital-humanities/](https://digitalsinology.org/classical-chinese-digital-humanities/)
