# Lucan's tres libri: A reconsideration of arrangement and argument in the *Bellum civile*
Classical Association of the Atlantic States Annual Meeting
October 4, 2018

{:.paper-section-heading}
## Abstract
The order of composition for the books of Lucan's *Bellum civile* has long been a source of debate. The biographical tradition refers to “three books” published during his lifetime and, in an example of scholarly Ockham's razor, these are generally assumed to be Books 1-2-3. Yet, there is not consensus. Masters (1992) states the question directly—“Which three books were published?”— challenging the assertion by Rose (1966) that anything except 1-2-3 is “out of the question.” Other suggestions include 1-7-9 (Ussani 1901), 2-7-8 (Pichon 1912), and 1-2-7 (Duff 1964). Bruère (1951) mentions that it is perhaps not the first three books, but is also likely not the last three.

In this paper I argue for a different arrangement, namely 7-8-9. I base this reading on three arguments from internal evidence: 1. the Battle of Pharsalus is the poem's centerpiece and it is inconceivable to have not been part of the work's original conception; 2. the close relationship between Book 3 and Book 4 in documenting the war's Western campaign suggests that they were composed in a coordinated manner; and 3. the unusual length and imbalanced content of Book 9, suggests a break in composition and rethinking of poetic design. In addition, with 7-8-9 assumed, a fourth closely related argument can be adduced, namely that Book 10, famously incomplete, provides several parallels to *Aeneid* 4, and accordingly makes sense as a book conceived as a structural allusion to its predecessor and the fourth book in its original design.

The consequences of assuming that Book 1 was written first, specifically that it was written before Book 7, are great: most recent arguments about Lucan's relationship with Nero are predicated on the idea that his disposition changed from fawning (whether ironically or not) to hostile (e.g. Ahl 1976; Dewar 1994; Nelis 2011). This argument, however, is compromised if Book 7 is shown to be the earlier composition, with the address to Nero (1.33-66) then representing an unsuccessful attempt to mitigate the disfavor that the poet found with the emperor and that cost him the right to declaim his poetry.
