## Description
As part of a three-week NEH institute on digital methods for working with historical-language text, we were asked to present on a potential application for what we had learned. I came up with a "plan to develop an introductory textbook for simultaneously teaching Latin and Greek" that would take advantage of digitized texts of early Modern Greek-Latin bilingual editions, in particular J. J. Scaliger's edition of the *Disticha Catonis*.  

Slides from this presentation are available at [http://bit.ly/burns-bilingual-directions](http://bit.ly/burns-bilingual-directions).
